# Wordpress Lightbox 
This is a configurable lightbox with EXIF and GPS mapping support that works with native Wordpress galleries and images. It is a configurable lightbox that displays images and photos in your Wordpress galleries in full screen, complete with file information, camera EXIF metadata, and embedded maps showing photo location. Unlike most existing lightboxes, it supports native Wordpress galleries and images, so it will always work and you need not be dependent on third-party gallery plugins. It is also highly configurable, and gives you control over almost every aspect of the lightbox's look and feel.

## Features

**EXIF**
Displays EXIF metadata for each image (if it is available) such as aperture, shutter speed, exposure (and many other tags). You can enable or disable the display of EXIF metadata for each gallery. For a list of all supported EXIF tags, please refer to the plugin's [documentation](https://www.acclectic.com/support/wordpress-lightbox-docs/).

**GPS Mapping**
Displays an embedded map showing the location at which the image was captured, based on GPS coordinates in the image metadata.

**Native gallery and image support**
Unlike most existing lightboxes, the Acclectic Lightbox works with native Wordpress galleries and images. This means that you do *not* need to create a custom gallery (with a third-party gallery plugin) in order to use the lightbox. It also means that the lightbox will always work wth Wordpress, and you are not dependent on third-party gallery plugins.

**Configuration**

**Integration across images and galleries**
If you have multiple images or galleries on a post or page, they can share a single lightbox. Or keep them separate via a simple button click.
